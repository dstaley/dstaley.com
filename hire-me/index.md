## About Me
I call myself a web developer, but in reality, I’m just obsessed learning new things. I recently graduated from Louisiana State University with a degree in Information Systems and Decision Sciences, along with LSU’s prestigious [Distinguished Communicator](http://sites01.lsu.edu/wp/cxc/distinguished-communicators/) certification. I’ve developed a passion for creating ambitious web applications, particularly in Ember, and am excited about the opportunity to work full-time on delivering amazing experiences on the web. If you’re looking to add an enthusiastic junior developer to your team, one whose passion for web development is only surpassed by their passion for learning, you should [check out some of my projects](/projects) and [get in touch](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01ZGES3iSWmUwr35sEbB8-VA==&c=rYCMJbZWWqZjEcPXkTRif-L6GYgEQfy9Xfc0Su1jXzA=).

## What I'm Looking For
I'm looking to join an established team of frontend developers at a company that wants to create amazing experiences on the web. I'd love to join a team that's as passionate about Ember as I am, but I would be open to learning new frameworks such as Angular and React. I'm looking for a team that will constantly challenge my abilities, push me to develop my strengths, help me identify my weaknesses, and encourage me to do my best work.

I understand there are gaps in my knowledge, and I want to join a team that's excited to help me fill them. In exchange, I promise to approach each and every problem I face with an exuberant amount of enthusiasm. After all, every problem you come up against is an opportunity to learn something new, and that's a huge motivator for me.

My dream company is one that values continuous learning and self-development, and is composed of people that get excited when they discover something they don't know. I want to be surrounded by people that get excited at the prospect of the unknown.

I want to join a team of people that share a commitment to increasing the representation of underrepresented minorities in the tech industry.

At the moment, I live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, but I'd prefer to relocate to a city with a more developed tech scene. Bonus points if your city has an Ember meetup group!
