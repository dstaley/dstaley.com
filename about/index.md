I'd call myself a web developer, but I think the term "web maker" is a better fit. I love building things that your browser gives you access to. I like everything from designing RESTful APIs to fussing over gradients on buttons.
I'm a huge advocate of using the right tools for the job, but my staples are Go and Ember.js (though I'm also buddy-buddy with Ruby and Python). I also love learning new things (almost as much as I love [teaching](/projects/webdevcourse) them!), and am willing to give anything a good try.
