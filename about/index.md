## In 140 words
I am a developer and designer from Baton Rouge, LA who is passionate about creating beautiful web applications. I love pushing the boundaries of what websites can do, and am frequently trying new techniques and technologies. At the moment, I like building applications in [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/), and building web services in [Go](http://golang.org/).

I am on track to graduate from Louisiana State University's E. J. Ourso College of Business in December 2014 with a degree in Information Systems and Decision Sciences. In addition to my degree, I am also a [Distinguished Communicator](http://sites01.lsu.edu/wp/cxc/distinguished-communicators/) candidate.

In addition to my passion for web development, I throughly enjoy sharing my knowledge with others. In the fall of 2013, I taught an [Introduction to Web Development](/projects/web-development-course) course, and was incredibly excited to see how much people were able to learn in a short amount of time.
