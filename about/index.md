I am a frontend web developer from Baton Rouge, LA who is passionate about creating beautiful web applications and teaching other to do the same. At the moment, I like building web apps in [Ember](http://emberjs.com/), and building web services in Python and [Go](http://golang.org/).

I recently graduated from Louisiana State University's E. J. Ourso College of Business in with a degree in Information Systems and Decision Sciences, which is the analysis, design, and implementation of systems to support the operations and management functions of an organization. In addition to my degree, I was also recognized as a [LSU Distinguished Communicator](http://sites01.lsu.edu/wp/cxc/distinguished-communicators/).

In addition to my passion for web development, I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others. I've taught an [Introduction to Web Development](/projects/web-development-course) course, along with numerous other workshops on topics ranging from [programming fundamentals](/projects/intro-to-programming/) to presentation design.
