# Hi, I'm Dylan

I've never been one to respect the status quo. I [code](/projects#development), [teach](/projects#community), [take pictures](http://instagram.com/dylanstaley), and sometimes [tweet](https://twitter.com/dstaley). People who know me usually have [nice things to say](/recommendations).

Things I like at the moment...

* [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/)
* [Go](http://golang.org/)
* [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/)
* Ben & Jerry's New York Super Fudge Chunk Ice Cream

If you're interested in seeing some of the work I've done, you can check out my [projects](/projects). If you like what you see (or if you have [really cool cat gifs](http://giphy.com/search/cat)), you should get in touch. [I'm on the internet](/social).
