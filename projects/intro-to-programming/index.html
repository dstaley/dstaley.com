title: Introduction to Programming

<p>Earlier this year, I posted the following my business fraternity's Facebook group:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you're interested in learning to code, but are daunted at the idea of learning on your own, leave a comment. I'm thinking about offering a few evening presentations to small groups of 10-15 people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before the end of the day, almost a quarter of our active members indicated that they would be interested in attending. With that in mind, I scheduled four workshops, each open to fifteen people. Within a week, over half the available slots were filled.</p>
<p>When asked "What is programming?", many of the attendees felt it was "a secret language" made only for "hardcore computer geeks". I was determined to show them that programming was actually more intuitive than people expected. What I didn't expect, however, were the several people who approached me after the workshops asking "What can I do to learn more?". As someone who is passionate about programming, I was completely ecstatic to hear that I had an impact on someone. I was incredibly taken aback when an attendee told me that I "should consider being an instructor". I've always toyed with the idea of pursuing a teaching career, but never before had I actually had someone I taught make this suggestion. To date, it's one of the best compliments I've ever received.</p>
