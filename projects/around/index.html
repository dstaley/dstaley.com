<p>around is an anonymous, realtime, location-based messaging application that connects you with people nearby. I built around as part of GeauxHack, the first student-run hackathon in Louisiana, and won third place.</p>
<p>Unlike other “anonymous” applications, around values true anonymity. We don’t require you to create an account, provide access to social media accounts, or provide access to your contacts. Authentication is provided by Firebase’s Simple Login service, and only persists as long as your session does. If you open around on three different devices, you’re identified as three separate user accounts.</p>
<p>around is built using Ember.js, Ratchet, and several Firebase technologies. Realtime data storage is provided by Firebase, optimized location queries are provided by GeoFire, authentication is handled by Simple Login, and it’s all hosted on Firebase Hosting.</p>

<p>When you log in to around, you’re presented with a list of all the rooms you’re within the vicinity of. Each room has a defined center and radius, which allows rooms to exist only within certain areas, say a building or city block, and are only displayed when you’re within that radius.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can create your own room. Simply provide a name and adjust the radius. Anyone within the circle will be able to access the room you’ve created.</p>

<p>After entering a room, you’ll see that all messages are accompanied by avatars, courtesy of Gravatar.</p>

<p>I’m currently in the process of developing native iOS and Android versions of around. I strongly believe in the web as a platform, and will continue to use the web version of around as a testbed for new features and designs.</p>
