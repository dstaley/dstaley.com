title: Beginning Web Development
---
<p>Late last year, one of my coworkers approached me about the possibility to teaching a small introduction to web development course for his wife and a few of her coworkers, all graphic designers. I had never taught a course in <em>anything</em>, let alone something as vast as web development. Never being one to shy away from a challenge, I agreed to teach the course.</p>
<p>For eight weeks, I met with a small group of 8 students and covered introductory topics in web development. We discussed the structure of URLs, and how they can mimic the file structure on your web server. We explored some of the most common HTML elements (thanks to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list">MDN HTML5 Element List</a>). We concluded with how to layout and style web pages with CSS.</p>
<p>Never before had I spent so much time teaching someone about something. It was both frightening ("Am I explaining this the best way?") and exhilarating. However, the most rewarding part was when one of the students, Jessica, shared her <a href="http://jessicawoconnor.com/">personal site</a> with me that she made during the course. My heart skipped a beat when I learned it was <a href="https://github.com/JWOConnor/JWOConnor.github.io">on GitHub</a> as well. I nearly cried with joy when I learned she also used the knowledge she acquired during the course to design a site for <a href="http://chrisweimer.info/">her younger brother</a>.</p>
<p>Having the privilege to share your passion with someone is an immense undertaking, and not one to be taken lightly. However, seeing how much it impacted Jessica (and by extension, myself), I think it's worth it.</p>
