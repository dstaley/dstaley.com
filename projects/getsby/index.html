<p><em>gets by</em> is a "collection of stories about living with a mental illness, as told by the tech community". When my good friend <a href="http://paddy.io/">Paddy Foran</a> approached me about doing the design for <em>gets by</em>, he didn't even need to say please. I enthusiastically agreed to give <em>gets by</em> the simple, beautiful, typographically-driven design the people sharing their stories deserved.</p>
<p>The stories on <em>gets by</em> are completely unedited; we do not screen interviewees, nor do we modify their stories in any way. Paddy put it this way in his <a href="http://paddy.io/posts/getting-by/">blog post about the launch</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything of value came from other people. The credit is theirs, not mine. I'm just the custodian, keeping things running.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> as a base, the design of <em>gets by</em> utilizes very simple elements to build an interface that looks great on any device. My favorite feature of the design is the alternating colors, which serve to create a distinction between the various heroes who've shared their stories and the section in their interviews.</p>

<p>Another great thing about <em>gets by</em> is that it's open source. When we say anyone can share their story, we mean <em>anyone</em>. Simply send a pull request to GitHub repo and your story will appear on the site, giving a whole new meaning to the term "open".</p>
