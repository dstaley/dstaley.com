<p><a href="https://github.com/dstaley/gover">Gover</a> was originally a simple, single-purpose Go application that collected metrics from my cryptocurrency mining rig, but it quickly evolved into a platform for collecting these metrics and sending them to various locations.</p>
<p>Primarily, Gover connects to a computer running cgminer (through the use of <a href="https://github.com/dstaley/cgminerapi">cgminerapi</a>, which provides Go bindings for cgminer's RPC API) and stores important metrics such as video card temperature, fan speed, and hashrate into a local SQLite database. When paired with <a href="https://github.com/dstaley/gover-web">gover-web</a>, an Ember.js web application, you gain access to your rig's historical data in a simple, visually appealing, responsive web interface accessible over your local network.</p>
<p>Gover's dashboard is intended as a high-level overview of your entire rig. In addition to overall metrics, the dashboard also includes a line-series chart (powered by <a href="http://www.flotcharts.org/">Flot</a>) showing the temperature and hashrate over time for all your video cards. This is useful for monitoring your rig's performance, as you're able to see if performance degrades over specific intervals.</p>

<p>In addition to storing data locally, Gover also allows you to send data to the excellent <a href="http://www.mobileminerapp.com/">Mobileminerapp</a> service, allowing you to monitor your rig from Android, iOS, and Windows Phone devices.</p>
