<p><a href="https://github.com/dstaley/gover">Gover</a> is my most ambitious project yet. Originally a simple, single-purpose Go application that collected metrics from my cryptocurrency mining rig, Gover has evolved into a platform for collecting these metrics and sending them to various locations.</p>
<p>Primarily, Gover connects to a computer running cgminer and stores important metrics such as video card temperature, fan speed, and hashrate into a local SQLite database. When paired with <a href="https://github.com/dstaley/gover-web">gover-web</a>, an Ember.js web application, you gain access to your rig's historical data in a simple, visually appealing, responsive web interface accessible over your local network.</p>
<p>Gover's dashboard is intended as a high-level overview of your entire rig. In addition to overall metrics, the dashboard also includes a line-series chart (powered by <a href="http://www.flotcharts.org/">Flot</a>) showing the temperature and hashrate over time for all your video cards. This is useful for monitoring your rig's performance, as you're able to see if performance degrades over specific intervals.</p>

<p>In addition to storing data locally, Gover also allows you to send data to the excellent <a href="http://www.mobileminerapp.com/">Mobileminerapp</a> service, allowing you to monitor your rig from Android, iOS, and Windows Phone devices.</p>
<p>The utility of Gover is limited in that you're only able to monitor one machine on your local network at a time. That's where my favorite part of this project comes in.</p>
<h2>"Next Stop: Everywhere"</h2>
<p>"Next Stop: Everywhere" (NSE for short) is the codename for a paid extension to Gover that allows you to access your rig's performance data from anywhere. Signing up for NSE will be handled through Coinbase's merchant tools, specifically the payment button. When you pay with Bitcoin through Coinbase, a callback is sent to NSE with your email address. A specific application token is generated and emailed to you, which you can then add to your Gover configuration. Once that's completed, Gover begins sending your rig's metrics to NSE, allowing you to monitor your performance from any internet-connected device.</p>
<p>The really exciting part of NSE is the technology it's built with. It uses <a href="https://github.com/square/cube/">Cube</a>, "a system for time series visualization", to store all the various metrics from your rigs. NSE also has an Ember.js web interface not unlike Gover, allowing you to view performance on a machine- and device-specific level.</p>
<p>NSE isn't quite finished yet, and I'm hoping to launch a public alpha in the coming weeks.</p>
